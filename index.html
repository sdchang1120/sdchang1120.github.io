      <blockquote>
        <p>"Hi there. My name is Sharon and I'm an aspiring web developer based in New York. I majored in Childhood Education with a concentration in Mathematics at New York University. However, it was when I took an intro to computer science course my last year at NYU that I wanted to pursure a career in tech.</p>
        <p>Upon graduation, I looked into tech jobs and even picked up a few languages on my own. I didn't know about dev bootcamps back then, so I tried to save as much money as I could so I can go to grad school for computer science. But with my entry-level salary, it would take me years to save enough money for grad school.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, a few coworkers and friends told me about 3-month long intensive bootcamps where I can learn the skills I need to become a junior-level developer. To be honest, I was skeptical at first, but I saw how my friends were getting jobs within a couple months of completing the program.This gave me hope and the best part is, I'll only have to pay a fraction of the amount it'll cost to go to grad school in just 3 months.</p>
        <p>I am determined to become a successful web developer and create beautiful, functional websites in the future. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me."</p>
